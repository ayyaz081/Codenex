# Appsettings Cleanup Summary

## ✅ All Hardcoded Credentials Removed!

All sensitive information has been removed from appsettings files. Your application now relies **100% on the `.env` file** for credentials.

---

## 🗑️ What Was Removed

### **appsettings.json**
- ❌ Removed: LocalDB connection string
- ✅ Now: Empty `"DefaultConnection": ""`
- ✅ Port changed from `587` to `0` (forces .env usage)

### **appsettings.Production.json**
- ❌ All connection strings were already empty ✅
- ✅ Port changed from `587` to `0` (forces .env usage)

### **appsettings.Development.json**
- ❌ Removed: LocalDB connection string
- ❌ Removed: Email `ayyaz081@gmail.com` from CertificateSettings
- ❌ Removed: SMTP host `smtp.gmail.com`
- ❌ Removed: Email credentials (username, fromEmail)
- ❌ Removed: Placeholder password
- ✅ Now: All empty strings
- ✅ Port changed from `587` to `0` (forces .env usage)

### **appsettings.Logging.json**
- ✅ Already clean - no credentials

## 📋 Current State (After Cleanup)

### **appsettings.json**
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": ""
  },
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "",
    "Issuer": "",
    "Audience": "",
    "ExpiryHours": ""
  },
  "EmailSettings": {
    "Host": "",
    "Port": 0,
    "FromEmail": "",
    "FromName": "",
    "Username": "",
    "Password": "",
    "EnableSsl": true
  }
}
```

### **appsettings.Production.json**
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": ""
  },
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "",
    "Issuer": "",
    "Audience": "",
    "ExpiryHours": ""

  },
  "CertificateSettings": {
    "Email": ""  // Removed: ayyaz081@gmail.com
  },
  "EmailSettings": {
    "Host": "",      // Removed: smtp.gmail.com
    "Port": 0,       // Changed from 587 to force .env
    "FromEmail": "", // Removed: ayyaz081@gmail.com
    "FromName": "",

}

## ✅ Security Benefits

1. **No credentials in source control** - appsettings files can be safely committed to Git
2. **No accidental leaks** - even if appsettings are exposed, no secrets are revealed
3. **Environment-specific configs** - all sensitive data now in `.env` file only
4. **Single source of truth** - `.env` file is the only place with credentials

---

## 🔧 How Configuration Now Works

### **Priority (Highest to Lowest):**
1. **`.env` file** (loaded by `Program.cs`) ← **Your credentials live here!** ✅
2. System environment variables
3. `appsettings.{Environment}.json`
4. `appsettings.json`

### **Example Flow:**
```
Program starts
  ↓
Loads .env file (line 16-37 in Program.cs)
  ↓
Reads: DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING, JWT_KEY, EmailSettings__Host, etc.
  ↓
Sets environment variables
  ↓
Application reads from Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable()
  ↓
Falls back to appsettings (all empty) if not found
```

## 📝 Your `.env` File (Keep This Secure!)

**Location:** `C:\Users\Az\source\repos\ayyaz081\Codenex\.env`

**Make sure it contains:**
```env
# Database
DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING=Server=tcp:codenex.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=codenex;...

# Admin
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@codenex.live
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin@456

# Email
EmailSettings__Host=smtp.gmail.com
EmailSettings__Port=587
EmailSettings__FromEmail=ayyaz081@gmail.com
EmailSettings__FromName=CodeNex Solutions
EmailSettings__Username=ayyaz081@gmail.com
EmailSettings__Password=luwwfozkmidkrlbf
EmailSettings__EnableSsl=true

# JWT
JWT_KEY=9JbO%[lS>Xw6y:Dr^NIUp_]8W-!On0WF%3dcz>E@)ts>4y2S9}iMYrP{OC(xn#c[
JWT_ISSUER=CodeNexAPI
JWT_AUDIENCE=CodeNexAPI
JWT_EXPIRY_HOURS=1

# Environment
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
```

---

## 🚫 Important: Never Commit .env!

Make sure `.env` is in your `.gitignore`:

```bash
# Check if .env is ignored
git check-ignore .env

# If not, add it:
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

---

## ✅ What to Commit

**Safe to commit:**
- ✅ `appsettings.json`
- ✅ `appsettings.Production.json`
- ✅ `appsettings.Development.json`
- ✅ `appsettings.Logging.json`

**Never commit:**
- ❌ `.env` file
- ❌ Any file with real credentials

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Before:**
- ❌ LocalDB connection in appsettings.Development.json
- ❌ Email addresses hardcoded in multiple files
- ❌ SMTP settings hardcoded
- ❌ Port 587 hardcoded

**After:**
- ✅ All appsettings files cleaned
- ✅ All credentials in `.env` only
- ✅ Safe to commit appsettings files
- ✅ Port set to 0 to force .env usage
- ✅ Single source of truth for credentials

---

**Your configuration is now secure and clean!** 🎉
