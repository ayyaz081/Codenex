## 🚀 How to Test (Quick Start)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
```bash
dotnet ef database update --project CodeNex.csproj
```

### Step 2: Get Stripe Test Keys
1. Sign up at: https://dashboard.stripe.com/register (free)
2. Go to: **Developers → API keys**
3. Copy both keys (pk_test_... and sk_test_...)

### Step 3: Setup GitHub Organization
1. Create organization at: https://github.com/settings/organizations
2. Create a **PRIVATE** repository in that organization
3. Generate Personal Access Token with `repo` and `admin:org` scopes

### Step 4: Update `.env` File
Replace these values in `.env`:
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_YOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN
GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_NAME=Your-Org-Name
```

### Step 5: Run & Test
```bash
dotnet run --project CodeNex.csproj
```

Then:
1. Login as admin (`admin@codenex.live` / `Admin@456`)
2. Go to Admin Panel → Repository
3. Add new premium repository with price
4. View on Repository page
5. Click "Purchase" button
6. Enter GitHub username
7. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
8. Check email for GitHub invitation!
